# Many, many, many projects
a bunch of unorganized projects I make that I don't know what to name. when I name them they will be removed and get their repository.
# About this clump
basically, the folder names are in this order: "{date that it started}, {short desc}".
they will all have their readme files, to make it easier when I move them.
# More
If you'd like to know more about a specific project, you can just look at its own readme.
